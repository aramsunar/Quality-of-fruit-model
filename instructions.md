Hey guys, there have been some changes that I still need to push.

I used Angelina's model and added a couple of tweaks to it. So now we have a few important things we need to talk about.

Firstly, we have different scenarios.

Scenario 1 is used as a baseline to identify the quality, scenario 2 uses grayscale images, scenario 3 uses augmented images (based on Angelina's model), and scenario 4 uses different sizes.

Then we can compare all the outputs and accuracies. This reflects everything we talked about in class this year.

Apart from that, we also have a part B which identifies the fruits and their quality to see the difference in accuracy of multi-classification vs. single-classification. It also has these four scenarios and uses one model across all of them.

So this gives us 'n super cool and well defined project.

I started the documentation so long. I will then do the Intro and Part A (single classification with its scenarios) then someone else can do Part B and finally someone can do the Conclusion. How does that sound?

Then for the presentstion next week we just do a basic Intro, Outcomes, Part A vs Part B + Results and finally Conclusion

Hey everyone, sorry for the late message. Just wanted to quickly send the documentation so long.

So I have previously mentioned that there were 4 scenarios in Part A and Part B, but the documentation is already like 40 pages, so I decided to remove scenario 4. Now there are only three scenarios (normal, grayscale and augmentation).

@Stefan du Plooy for Part B, you can follow the exact same structure and format that is depicted in Part A. On the development branch, check the “reports” folder for the data to use. Everything for part B is identified by “multitask” part.

@Angelina Ramsunar you can wait for Stefan to finish his part and just write a comprehensive conclusion talking about how we tested different scenarios to demonstrate different applications of theory and then also just quickly reference Part A results vs Part B results (if you want, not critical) and then conclude the document.

Will both of you please also just check the formatting of the document, there might be places something slipped
